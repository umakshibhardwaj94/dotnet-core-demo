Fundamental of Garbage collection:

-Manages memory automatically which eliminates the problem  such as forgetting to free an object causing memory leakage or attempt to access memory that is already free.

-Benefits:
	-manages memory automatically.
	-reclaims object thta are no longer use,keeps memory available for future allocations.
	-manages objects automaticaly get clean content to start with, so their constructors dont have to initialize every data field.
	-provides memory safety so that one object cannot use the memory of another object.


Fundamentals of memory:
	-Each process has its own virtual space. All process on same computer shares the same physical memory and the page file,if there is one.
	-By defualt, in 32bit computer,each process has 2GB user-mode virtual address space.
	-as a developer, we work with vitual memory only.
	-Virtual memory can be in three state:
a).Free : The block of memory that is free for allocation.
b).Reserved :The block of memory is available for your use and cant use for another allocation request.However, u cannot store the data to this memory block until it is committed.
c).Committed :block of memory is assigned to physical storage.

	-Virtual address space can get fragmented.This means a block of space which is free is called as holes in address space.
	-if the virtual memory allocation is requested, the virtual memory manager has to find a single free block that is large enough to satisfy the requested amount of space.
	-you can run out of memory if there isn't enough virtual address space to reserve or physical space to commit.
